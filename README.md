Project 4:  Implement an elevator application with the help of a Doubly linked list.  Starting from a ground level, the customer enters the level of flour he wants to reach. But there can be more than one customer getting in the elevator. So each one of them presses their level of flour to reach. The application should stop at the entered level for each customer and get more customers as well on each flour and get their destination levels.  As you know, the elevator goes only moves up all the way to the highest level the customer requested and then comes down if there is any customers. If not, it goes back to the ground flour.  Use Doubly Linked List Queue for the above-mentioned project.  Follow the SDLC pattern, Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing and Documentation.
